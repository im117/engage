## Project Description
Engage (name tentative) is a mobile/web application that aims to host short form video content similar to TikTok, but have more of a focus on privacy and customization. The app will allow users to create and share short videos with each other and the world, and will prioritize privacy by considering algorithms that respect the user's agency and privacy. This aims to give the user more control of what they see, by subscribing to categories/sub-categories. Features that may be included are custom theming, new customization options for profiles, and more as development progresses. The ~~app~~ website will be developed using ~~Flutter~~, React, SCSS, npm, git, docker, and Postgres.

- **Johnny Zheng**: Hello, I am a computer science major in my senior year at Eastern Michigan University. I am a reserved person who values growth and improvement. Although I value my alone time, I do like interacting and collaborating with others. Even though I don't consider myself as a leader, I am not afraid to take command if that becomes necessary. Some of my standout traits are my persistence and my ability to learn quickly. Moreover, I am constantly working at developing my interests and becoming better at the things that I am good at whether that would be coding, art, cooking, or chess. It is not hard for me to lose myself for hours perfecting a skill.
